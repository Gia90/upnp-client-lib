<h2>Info</h2>

This is upnp-client library totally based on python. I did it, because python deffinetly misses one - all the stuff i found was based on C++ code and had bindings to python. Also it was fun to try out socket's.

This library comes without any warranty. I would even say, i didn't bother too much with it - the only thing i dare to promise, it should work on Ubuntu and maybe even some over Debian based distro.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
Most of Open Source projects have problems with documentation - and this library is not an exception. 

Code is self exploritary and even contains unit tests.

<h2>Credits</h2>
A lot of stuff you see here is based on miranda source (total rip-off if you ask me). I warmly thank authors of this tool and I give back to OpenSource community because of it.
